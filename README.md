Web Scraping Challenge

In Homework 11, the task involved using web scraping to extract information from NASA's article on the Martian light show caused by a solar storm. Additionally, a CSV file provided data on Martian weather, including date, sol, month, temperature, and pressure. The process was split between two notebooks: one focused on scraping and storing article titles, while the other analyzed Martian weather data, such as plotting temperature by month. This exercise offered a valuable hands-on experience in web scraping and data analysis.
